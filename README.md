# Real-State-Management System

## Introduction
This Real-State-Management System is a user-friendly dynamic web application designed for the database management of a real-estate office. It comprises three main modules: Buyers, Agents, and Sellers. Sellers can upload their property details, and Buyers can buy properties by contacting the Agents. The application allows CRUD operations on these modules and displays updated data accordingly.

## Features
- *Buyers Module*: Allows buyers to view available properties and contact agents.
- *Agents Module*: Manages property listings and facilitates communication between buyers and sellers.
- *Sellers Module*: Enables sellers to upload property details for potential buyers.
- *CRUD Operations*: Supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for all modules.
- *Dynamic Data Update*: Ensures data is always current and reflective of the latest changes.

## Tech Stack
